### 🚀 My Skills 

    · Backend Development: Proficient in Python (Django, Flask), Node.js (Express), and Java (Spring Boot).
    · Frontend Development: Skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js.
    · Databases: Experienced with MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
    · Other Tools: Familiar with Git, Docker, RESTful APIs, JWT, and OAuth.
    · Penetration Testing Expertise: I possess extensive expertise in penetration testing methodologies, tools,
      and techniques. With a deep understanding of network security and system vulnerabilities, I conduct thorough
      assessments to identify potential weaknesses in systems, applications, and infrastructure. Leveraging both
      automated and manual testing approaches, I simulate real-world attack scenarios to uncover security flaws
      and assess the overall security posture of organizations.
    · Comprehensive Vulnerability Analysis: I specialize in conducting comprehensive vulnerability analyses across
      diverse environments, including web applications, networks, and cloudinfrastructures. Through meticulous
      examination and testing, I identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential
      impact. I utilize industry-standard frameworks such as OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and
      CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to ensure thorough coverage and accuracy in my assessments.
    · Risk Mitigation and Remediation: As a seasoned penetration tester, I not only identify security
      weaknesses but also provide actionable recommendations for risk mitigation and remediation. I collaborate
      closely with stakeholders to develop tailored security solutions and implement effective controls to address
      identified vulnerabilities. By assisting organizations in strengthening their security posture and enhancing
      their resilience against cyber threats, I contribute to safeguarding sensitive data and preserving business continuity.
